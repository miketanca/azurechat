hey Tan, Michael! i was wondering if you can look into something for us when it comes to azure chat 
 
specfically in azure chat when you create a new chat can the default persona be set to something we specify
 
and when you  click new chat it already points to documents that have already been index in azure search 
 
+ also allow for  a new chat to trigger a specific extention as well
